## Old Fulp

This is my attempt to bring TheSwain/Fulpstation (2020 April Fulp code) to work on modern day BYOND, mostly just for fun.
This is meant to work without config because I don't want there to have a ton of Admin work to do.
You can see changes by searching 'OLD FULP'

This has the ported React TGUI rather than the old Inferno, which requires a bit more work to maintain but it was needed for the build to work properly.
